I completely understand your concern! You want to generate a video without altering any of your current settings (scripts, VMD display, etc.), and keeping the workflow that already works for you. Here's a non-invasive solution:
Steps to create the video without changing settings

Open VMD as usual:
Run your usual command (it won't change anything):
bash

vmd -e visualize-polymer.tcl -args Simulations/Test4/initial-condition.gro Simulations/Test4/trajectory-file-0.trr

Verify that everything looks as usual (colors, rendering, etc.).

Generate the video in a temporary directory:

Option A (Recommended): Use VMD's Movie Maker without modifying your visualization:

Go to Extensions → Visualization → Movie Maker.

In "Movie Settings":

Renderer: Tachyon (high quality) or Snapshot (fast).

Format: MPEG-1 (.mpg) or QuickTime (.mov).

FPS: 24 or 30.

Under "Trajectory": Select "Use trajectory".

Important! Under Working Directory: Choose a new folder (e.g., /tmp/video_frames/) to avoid mixing files with your simulation.

Click "Make Movie".
